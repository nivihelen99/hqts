# This .gitkeep file ensures the directory is tracked by Git.
# Placeholder for project documentation.
# This directory will contain user guides, API documentation (e.g., Doxygen output),
# design documents, and other relevant documentation.
# The existing docs/requirement.md at the project root is separate from this.
