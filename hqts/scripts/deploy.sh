# This script will contain commands to deploy the HQTS project.
# This could involve copying binaries to remote servers, deploying to containers, etc.

# Add deployment steps here. Examples:
# 1. Packaging:
#    ./scripts/build.sh -t Release # Ensure release build
#    cd "${PROJECT_DIR}/build"
#    cpack -C Release # Or custom packaging
#    PACKAGE_NAME="hqts-${VERSION}.tar.gz" # Adjust as needed

# 2. Copying to a remote server:
#    REMOTE_USER="user"
#    REMOTE_HOST="server.example.com"
#    REMOTE_PATH="/opt/hqts"
#    echo "Copying ${PACKAGE_NAME} to ${REMOTE_USER}@${REMOTE_HOST}:${REMOTE_PATH}"
#    scp "${PROJECT_DIR}/build/${PACKAGE_NAME}" "${REMOTE_USER}@${REMOTE_HOST}:${REMOTE_PATH}/"
#    ssh "${REMOTE_USER}@${REMOTE_HOST}" "cd ${REMOTE_PATH} && tar -xzf ${PACKAGE_NAME} && ./install_remote.sh"

# 3. Deploying to Docker registry:
#    IMAGE_NAME="your-docker-registry/hqts:${VERSION}"
#    docker build -t "${IMAGE_NAME}" -f "${PROJECT_DIR}/docker/Dockerfile" "${PROJECT_DIR}"
#    docker push "${IMAGE_NAME}"

echo "Deployment script needs to be configured based on actual deployment targets."
echo "HQTS deployment script finished."

cd "${PROJECT_DIR}"
